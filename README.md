- **Before going further look first look for the architecture flow of my small project of 1st slide.**


-----------------------------------------------------***Key Features and Achievements:***----------------------

🛠️ Node.js Application Development:
Developed a Node.js application to display basic employee information.
Implemented a simple API to serve employee data in JSON format.

🐳 Docker Containerization:
Pulled the official Node.js Docker image and used it as the base for the application.

Created a Dockerfile to automate the build process, ensuring the application and its dependencies are correctly packaged.

🔄 Nodemon Integration:
Integrated Nodemon into the Docker container to enable automatic restarting of the Node.js server upon code changes, enhancing development efficiency and reducing downtime.

💾 Volume Management:
Configured Docker volumes to persist data and allow real-time updates. This setup ensured that changes to the source code were immediately reflected in the running container without the need for manual restarts.

⚙️ Docker Compose Setup:
Utilized Docker Compose to manage multi-container environments, facilitating seamless integration and management of different services such as the application server.

📦 Docker Hub Deployment:
Pushed the Docker image to Docker Hub, making it easily accessible and shareable. This step ensures that the application can be pulled and run on any system with Docker installed, promoting portability and ease of deployment.

🔧 Enhanced Development Workflow:
Leveraged Docker's capabilities to create an isolated and consistent development environment, ensuring that the application runs identically across different development and production environments.
Technical Skills Demonstrated:
🐳 Docker & Containerization
