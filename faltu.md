Updating a Node.js Application with Docker and Nodemon
Step 1: Pull the Node.js Image from Docker Swarm
You can pull the Node.js image from Docker Swarm using the CLI or directly from Docker Desktop.




Step 2: Create a Folder for the Node.js Project
Create a new folder for your Node.js project.



Step 3: Install Node and NPM
Install Node.js and npm to set up the project dependencies. Initialize a new Node.js project with the following command:

bash
Copy code
npm init
This will create a package.json file.



Step 4: Create an index.js File
Create an index.js file for your basic project.



Step 5: Run the Project on localhost
Run your Node.js application on localhost port 3000 with the following command:

bash
Copy code
node index.js


Here's the interface of our project where we have some employee data:



Step 6: Create a Docker Image for the Project
Create a Dockerfile in your project directory with the necessary commands to initialize the server. Build a Docker image of your application using the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t <image-name> .
You can see all the commands and flow here:



Check the created Docker image via CLI or Docker Desktop:

bash
Copy code
docker images



Step 7: Create a Container with Docker Desktop
Create and run the container using Docker Desktop:




Here's a better view of the running container:



Automating Server Updates with Nodemon
We need to address a problem with our server: updating our application currently requires manual intervention, which takes a significant amount of time and results in extended server downtime. To solve this, we need a solution that automates the server update process, minimizing downtime. This is where Nodemon comes into play. Nodemon is a server automation service that will restart the server within milliseconds during updates, greatly improving our efficiency.
